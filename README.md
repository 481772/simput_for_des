# Parflow hydrologic model
This is a simput model for the [parflow simulation system](https://parflow.org/).
# Merge process
I can't add this as a PR from my Simput fork into Kitware/Simput because it has no shared history with a branch in that repo. Here's my process instead:

```
1) Ask someone with credentials on Kitware/Simput to add this repo as a remote.
2) Ask them to checkout this branch.
3) Ask them to follow the instructions on the README.md as if this branch were the new repo.
```
