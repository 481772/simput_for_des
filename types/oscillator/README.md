# Oscillator

This Simput type is meant to illustrate a basic usage of simput for generating a descriptor file that can be used for an oscillator simulator such as the [vtkm source](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk-m/tree/master/examples/oscillator) or [Sensei example](https://gitlab.kitware.com/sensei/sensei/tree/master/miniapps/oscillators).

## Using Simput to generate your system definition file

Simput provides a simple user interface to define a set of oscillator and let you generate the configuration that should be used any of the oscillator simulation code listed above.
